The Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM)
===================================

**GloGEM** is an IDL package which allows to model the evolution of all 200.000 glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets.
The model is forced by monthly temperature and precipitation from 14 GCMs and three emission scenarios. In contrast to previous 
global-scale glacier models, GloGEM includes mass loss due to frontal ablation of marine-terminating glaciers.
